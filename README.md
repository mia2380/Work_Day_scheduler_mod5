# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## The Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## The Process:

The application ressembles a daily planner. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. The timeblocks for standard business hours are displayed. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks into a timeblock, the user can enter an event. When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist. to delete the saved events, the user can click on the text box and delete the entry.
